# About

Viscous is a Visual Studio extension for developing, compiling, and deploying [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) smart contracts to EVM-compatible blockchain networks.

## Features

* Solidity project system for Visual Studio featuring Solidity compiler integration and NPM dependency management. Integrates with the Visual Studio **New Project…** and **Open Folder…** dialogs.

* Uses Solidity language server for syntax highlighting, hover information, IntelliSense, and linting. 

* Solidity compiler integration with MSBuild and the Visual Studio Build command - compile Solidity projects and individual files from the IDE with errors reported in the Error List tool window.

* Generate .NET bindings to Solidity smart contracts automatically using Nethereum.

* Manage EVM networks, endpoints, accounts, deploy profiles, and deployed contracts from the **Blockchain Explorer** tool window.

* Deploy a compiled contract to a blockchain network and call its functions from inside Visual Studio.

* Find vulnerabilities and code‑quality issues with [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) static analysis inside Visual Studio.

## Requirements
* Visual Studio 2022 and above
* A recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or compatible runtime
* Python 3.8+

## Getting started
### Downloading
Get the latest release from the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/allisterb/Viscous/releases) page or use the [MyGet dev feed](https://www.myget.org/feed/viscous/package/vsix/Viscous.fe71db81-5086-4b1a-ad5d-867bb84d2441): Add https://www.myget.org/F/viscous/vsix/ as an Extension Gallery in the Visual Studio Extensions settings and you can then install it in the usual way.

### Building
1. Build the extension inside Visual Studio
2. Run the extension in the Visual Studio Experimental Instance

Edit the %LOCALAPPDATA%\Viscous\appsettings.json file to set different paths to the Node.js and npm and Python executables you want to use for the extension's language server and other tools. The extension's private .npmrc has `ignore-scripts=true`

## Usage Notes
* The very first time you open a Solidity file the extension will install the Node.js language server package in the extension's private `node_modules` directory. This will take a few seconds to complete and Solidity IntelliSense and hover information etc. won't be available during this time. Once the language server is installed the first time, editing Solidity contracts will be as usual.
